  ~Easing-function~ displays the current speed of animation to make it more
  realistic.

  The real object doesn’t begin its movement instantly and at a constant rate.
  When we open the drawer, we’ll first give it the acceleration, and then
  slowing it. When something falls, it first flew faster and faster,
  but it hit the floor and bounces back.

  This page will help each time to pick the desired easing-function.
