  ~Easing function~ specifies the speed of animation progresses
  to make it more realistic.

  The real object doesnâ€™t begin its movement instantly and at a constant rate.
  When we open the drawer, we first give it acceleration, and then we slow
  it down. When something falls, it first goes down faster and faster, and then
  bounces back after it hits the floor.

  This page will each time help to pick the desired easing function.
