  ~Easing function~ specifies the speed of animation progresses
  to make it more realistic.

  The real object doesn’t begin its movement instantly and at a constant rate.
  When we open the drawer, we first give it acceleration, and then we slow
  it down. When something falls, it first goes down faster and faster, and then
  bounces back after it hits the floor.

  This page will each time help to pick the desired easing function.

  js: !!format
    jQuery with jQuery Easing Plugin is the easiest way to describe animation
    with easing. You need just set easing name to `.animate` method as
    third argument or `easing` key.
  sass: !!format
    Sass/SCSS help you to describe animation. Compass remove prefixes before
    `transition` and `animation` properties and Compass Ceaser plugin allow
    to set easing by it name (without Bezier curves).
  css: !!format
    CSS properties `transition` and `animation` allow you to set easing
    function. Unfortunately, them support not all easings and you must set
    function by Bezier curve.
  css_help:
    Select easing to show it description in Bezier curve.
  no_css: !!format
    Unfortunately, CSS doesn’t support this easing. But you can use it by
    JavaScript or special CSS Animation `@keyframes`.
