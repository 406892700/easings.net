To build site and test your fix/translation you’ll need to have Ruby and
Bundler installed. For example, in a Debian-based (e.g. Ubuntu) environment:

```sh
sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1 ruby1.9.1-dev
sudo gem1.9.1 install bundler --no-user-install --bindir /usr/bin
```

That’s all. To build HTML just execute:

```sh
bundle exec rake build
```

While development, you can run `watch` task to rebuild site on every files
change:

```sh
bundle exec rake watch
```
